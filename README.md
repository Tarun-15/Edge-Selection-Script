Maya Script: Efficiently Select Alternate Edges

This Python script, selection_edges.py, streamlines the process of selecting every other edge within a set of chosen edges in Autodesk Maya. It addresses a common workflow requirement for tasks like:

Reducing edge density while preserving key features.
Simplifying complex meshes for faster rendering.
Applying operations sequentially to alternating edges.
Key Features:

Easy to Use: Simply select the desired edges in Maya and run the script.
Robust Error Handling: Checks if edges are selected, providing a clear warning if not.
Efficient: Deselects all edges upfront to optimize the selection process.
Clear and Concise Code: Well-formatted and commented for readability.
Usage:

Save the script: Place the code in a .py file (e.g., select_alternate_edges.py).
Run the script: In Maya, go to Script Editor > Python > Run Script (or use a keyboard shortcut).
Select edges: Choose the edges you want to work with in the Maya viewport.
Execute the script: The script will deselect all edges and then select every other edge from the originally selected set.
Customization:

The core logic focuses on selecting alternate edges. To modify the selection pattern (e.g., every third or fourth edge), adjust the modulo (division remainder) condition within the for loop.
Future Considerations:

Explore adding options to select every nth edge (where n is a user-defined value).
Consider integrating the script into Maya's interface as a custom command or shelf button for smoother accessibility.
Contribution:

Feel free to share your ideas or suggest improvements to make this script even more useful for the Maya community. I'm open to making this a collaborative effort!

Additional Notes:

If you're running this script for the first time, ensure the Maya Python plug-in is enabled (go to Preferences > Plug-in Manager > Show All Items > Show: Python (2.7)).
For more complex mesh manipulations, consider using Maya's built-in tools or third-party plugins depending on your specific needs.
